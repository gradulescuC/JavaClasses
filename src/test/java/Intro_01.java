        A variable is a location in memory to hold data. To indicate the storage area, each variable should be given a unique name.
        In order to use a variable, we must first declare it
        declaration of a variable = reserving memory for it
        The declaration of a variable can be done through specifying its data type and its name
        Data type = propery that tells the system what kind of information can we store inside a variable
        After we declare the variable we need to save some information in it in order to use it. This process is called initialization

        Rules for naming variables:

        Names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs
        Names must begin with a letter
        Names should start with a lowercase letter and it cannot contain whitespace
        Names are case sensitive ("myVar" and "myvar" are different variables)
        Reserved words (like Java keywords, such as int or boolean) cannot be used as names
