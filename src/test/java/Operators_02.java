//         ! - means NOT - it will check the oposite of the condition (usually used when we want to check if something is false)


        /*

        Example of using the NOT operator:
        We are on a webpage and we want to check if a button is displayed, but only want to treat the case in which
        it is not, otherwise we want to move on.

        In this case we can do like this:

        if(!isDisplayed()){
        System.put.println("Error: The button is not visible on the webpage. Test execution will be stopped")
        }

        In this case the condition "!isDisplayed()" will do the exact same thing as "isDisplayed() == False", the only
        difference being that it is shorter
